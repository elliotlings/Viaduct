## Bugs and issues

If you believe you have a bug or issue that needs investigating:

* Search the other issues to make sure that it hasn't been reported already.
* Open an issue, or add to an existing one, and provide as much detail as possible.
* If you can, accompany the report with a stripped back test case via
  [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/).

## Pull requests

If submitting a pull request:

* Follow the predefined code style used in the framework.
* Carry out all your work in a suitably-named branch, e.g.
  `bugfix/grid-widths`, `feature/some-new-object` etc.
* Commit sensibly and descriptively.
* Ensure that the whole framework still compiles without error.
* Submit all pull requests against the `incoming` branch. Any pull requests
  submitted against `master` **will** be declined.
* Advise on versioning if possible; if the changes require a version bump or
  merely a patch bump, please let us know.

## Feature requests

We're open to requests for adding new features, but please bear in mind:

* Make sure it fits in the with ideals and scope of the project; it has a
  very specific purpose and all features need to tie in with this.
* Have a go at adding the new functionality yourself and opening a pull request.
* **Discuss any features before attempting to develop them yourself;** I would
  hate for anyone to spend a tonne of time on something that I end up rejecting.
